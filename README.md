# Brookhaven-Lab-Quantum-Information-Science
Participated in QIS 101, a Brookhaven-led quantum computing bootcamp. Learned Qiskit, quantum algorithms (Grover, VQE), and core topics in scientific computing, linear algebra, Fourier analysis, and Monte Carlo methods. Applied quantum concepts to real-world domains via hands-on labs and demos.
